If you work in the display industry, you have likely encountered this frustration: analyzing color gamuts requires expensive software licenses, and even a simple color coordinate conversion demands a complex installation process on a specific operating system.

**Display Lab** was born from this exact problem. We set out to build professional-grade analysis tools that display engineers and researchers can access instantly from any web browser, with zero installation and zero cost.

## Why Display Lab?

The display industry relies on well-established tools. Fluxim's Phelos and Portrait Displays' CalMAN are powerful solutions, but they share common barriers to entry.

- **High licensing costs**: Annual fees running into thousands of dollars put them out of reach for individual researchers and small teams
- **Installation friction**: Many require specific operating systems or complex configuration procedures
- **Sharing limitations**: Collaborators need the same software installed to view your analysis results

Display Lab addresses all three problems simultaneously. It is **free, runs directly in the browser, and lets you share results with a single URL**. And it does all this without compromising on analytical precision.

## Core Features

Display Lab offers eight essential analysis tools covering display evaluation and color science.

### Color Gamut Analyzer

Visualize panel color gamuts on CIE 1931 and CIE 1976 chromaticity diagrams. Quantitatively compare coverage against standard gamuts including sRGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. Overlay multiple panels simultaneously for intuitive side-by-side comparison.

### Viewing Angle Analyzer

Analyze viewing angle characteristics of displays. Track color shift and luminance variation as a function of angle, making it straightforward to objectively compare viewing angle performance between OLED and LCD panels.

### HDR Analyzer

Evaluate key performance metrics for HDR displays. Assess ST.2084 (PQ) curve-based EOTF characteristics, peak luminance, contrast ratio, and tone mapping accuracy in a comprehensive dashboard.

### Spectrum Analyzer

Input spectral data to visualize intensity distribution by wavelength, with automatic calculation of chromaticity coordinates and correlated color temperature. CSV file upload is supported for direct import from measurement instruments.

### CRI/TLCI/TM-30 Calculator

Calculate three major color rendering metrics in a single workflow. Beyond traditional CRI (Ra), Display Lab supports TLCI for broadcast lighting evaluation and IES TM-30, the latest color rendition assessment methodology.

### Panel Comparator

Place two or more display panels side by side and compare key specifications. Automatically generates comparison tables across color gamut, luminance, contrast ratio, response time, and other critical parameters.

### Universal Converter

Handle the unit conversions that color science professionals need daily. Convert between CIE XYZ, xyY, L\*a\*b\*, L\*u\*v\*, and RGB color spaces, plus calculate correlated color temperature (CCT) and Duv, all in one place.

### Color Science Calculator

A collection of essential color science computation tools. Calculate color differences (Delta E), chromaticity coordinates on the Planckian locus, metameric analysis, and other calculations that researchers and practitioners use regularly.

## Technical Foundation

Display Lab builds on a proven technical foundation from SidequestLab's earlier project, **ISCV (Interactive Spectrum & Color Visualizer)**. The spectrum visualization engine and chromaticity calculation algorithms validated in ISCV serve as the backbone for Display Lab's broader display analysis capabilities.

Rather than simply copying code, we redesigned these components through modularization and abstraction into reusable, testable units. This is a prime example of SidequestLab's principle of recycling technical assets across projects.

The current technology stack includes:

- **React 19**: Leveraging concurrent features for responsive, fluid UI interactions
- **Vite 7**: Fast development experience with optimized production builds
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for color science calculations where precision matters
- **D3.js**: Professional-grade visualizations for chromaticity diagrams and spectral charts
- **Tailwind CSS**: Consistent design system across all tools

## What Comes Next

Display Lab has completed through Phase 2-B, and Phase 2-C will introduce capabilities that take the platform to the next level.

- **Database integration**: Save and manage analysis history over time
- **PDF report generation**: Export analysis results as professional reports
- **API access**: RESTful API for integration with external systems and automation workflows

We are eager to hear from professionals working in the display field. Tell us which features matter most to you and where we can improve.
