## "I Didn't Go to the Second Round - Why Am I Paying the Same?"

Friday night. A fun group dinner wraps up, and then this message drops in the group chat. Sound familiar?

Round 1 was dinner with all 6 people. Round 2 was drinks with only 4. Round 3 was karaoke with just 3. But when it comes time to settle up and you split the total evenly among 6 people, things get unfair fast.

"I only went to dinner - why am I paying the same as someone who stayed out all night?"

"The people who went to Round 3 should definitely pay more..."

How do you settle this fairly? Today, we'll walk you through the easiest and most accurate way to split bills across multiple rounds.

## Why Multi-Round Splitting Is So Tricky

There are three reasons multi-round settlements get complicated.

### 1. Different People at Each Round

- Round 1: All 6 people
- Round 2: Only 4 joined
- Round 3: Only 3 stayed

Each round should only be split among those who actually participated, but calculating this manually is a recipe for mistakes.

### 2. Different Amounts at Each Round

- Round 1 (Dinner): $120.00
- Round 2 (Drinks): $64.00
- Round 3 (Karaoke): $36.00

When everyone only owes for the rounds they attended, the math gets messy quickly.

### 3. Multiple People Paying

- Alex paid for Round 1
- Jamie paid for Round 2
- Sam paid for Round 3

Figuring out who owes what to whom - that's where it really gets complicated.

## Method 1: Manual Calculation (Spreadsheet or Calculator)

The most traditional approach is to crunch numbers by hand or set up a spreadsheet.

**Pros:**
- No app installation needed
- Accurate if you do the math right

**Cons:**
- Takes a long time (typically 10-15 minutes)
- High risk of calculation errors
- Awkward to share a spreadsheet with the group
- Hard to optimize the number of payment transfers

Once you try it yourself, you'll realize that even with just 3 rounds, figuring out who sends how much to whom is surprisingly complex.

## Method 2: Settle It in Under a Minute with NBbang Calculator

[NBbang Calculator](https://nbbang.click) is a web-based tool designed specifically for multi-round bill splitting. No app to download - just open it in your browser and go.

**Pros:**
- Set different participants for each round
- Automatic payment optimization (minimizes transfers)
- Share results instantly via messaging apps
- Done in under a minute

**Cons:**
- Doesn't handle the actual money transfer (you'll still use Venmo, Zelle, PayPal, etc.)

The key feature of NBbang Calculator is **round-by-round settlement**. You can set separate participants and amounts for each round, so even the most complex multi-round bills get calculated accurately.

## Real Example: Splitting a 3-Round Night Out with 6 People

Let's walk through a concrete example.

### The Setup

**Participants (6 people total)**
- Alex, Jamie, Sam, Riley, Morgan, Taylor

**Breakdown by Round**

| Round | Venue | Participants | Amount | Who Paid |
|-------|-------|-------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Dinner | All 6 | $120.00 | Alex |
| 2 | Drinks | 4 (Alex, Jamie, Sam, Riley) | $64.00 | Jamie |
| 3 | Karaoke | 3 (Alex, Sam, Riley) | $36.00 | Sam |

### How to Use NBbang Calculator

#### Step 1: Add Participants

Go to [nbbang.click](https://nbbang.click) and enter the names of all 6 participants.

- Alex
- Jamie
- Sam
- Riley
- Morgan
- Taylor

#### Step 2: Add Rounds

Click the "Add Round" button to create 3 rounds.

- Round 1: Dinner
- Round 2: Drinks
- Round 3: Karaoke

#### Step 3: Enter Expenses

Now enter the payment details for each round.

**Round 1 - Dinner ($120.00)**
- Paid by: Alex
- Participants: Select all (6 people)
- Each person's share: $20.00

**Round 2 - Drinks ($64.00)**
- Paid by: Jamie
- Participants: Select Alex, Jamie, Sam, Riley (4 people)
- Each person's share: $16.00

**Round 3 - Karaoke ($36.00)**
- Paid by: Sam
- Participants: Select Alex, Sam, Riley (3 people)
- Each person's share: $12.00

#### Step 4: View Settlement Results

Once you've entered everything, NBbang Calculator automatically computes the results.

**Total Each Person Owes**
- Alex: $48.00 (Round 1: $20 + Round 2: $16 + Round 3: $12)
- Jamie: $36.00 (Round 1: $20 + Round 2: $16)
- Sam: $48.00 (Round 1: $20 + Round 2: $16 + Round 3: $12)
- Riley: $48.00 (Round 1: $20 + Round 2: $16 + Round 3: $12)
- Morgan: $20.00 (Round 1 only)
- Taylor: $20.00 (Round 1 only)

**Optimized Payment Transfers**

NBbang Calculator minimizes the number of transfers needed.

- Morgan sends Alex $20.00
- Taylor sends Jamie $16.00
- Riley sends Sam $12.00
- Alex sends Jamie $4.00

That's it - just **4 transfers** and everyone is settled up.

### How Does This Compare to Manual Calculation?

To do the same thing by hand, you'd need to:

1. Check who attended each round (3 times)
2. Calculate each person's share (6 people x 3 rounds = 18 calculations)
3. Figure out how much each payer is owed
4. Optimize the transfer sequence

That easily takes 10+ minutes and is prone to errors.

NBbang Calculator handles all of this **automatically in under a minute**.

## Tips for Smoother Settlements

### 1. Designate a Treasurer Before the Night Starts

Decide who's handling the settlement ahead of time. That person enters each round into NBbang Calculator and shares the results with the group when the night's over.

### 2. Take Photos of Receipts

Snap a picture of the receipt after each round's payment. It helps a lot when you're entering amounts later, especially with 3+ rounds.

### 3. Enter Expenses in Real Time

Instead of waiting until the end of the night, enter each round into the calculator as it happens. It's much easier than trying to remember everything afterward.

### 4. Screenshot and Share the Results

Take a screenshot of the settlement results and drop it in the group chat. Everyone can see exactly who needs to send how much at a glance.

### 5. Settle Up on the Spot

Once the results are ready, make the transfers right then and there. Putting it off usually means someone forgets.

## How NBbang Compares to Other Tools

There are other bill-splitting tools out there, so why use NBbang Calculator?

### Splitwise

- Pros: Tracks ongoing balances across multiple events
- Cons: Everyone needs an account; can be overkill for a single night out

### Venmo / Zelle / PayPal

- Pros: Handles the actual money transfer
- Cons: No built-in multi-round splitting; you need to calculate amounts yourself

### NBbang Calculator

- Pros: Multi-round splitting, selective participants per round, optimized transfers
- Cons: Doesn't handle the actual money transfer

**For a simple even split**, any payment app will do. But for **multi-round nights out with different people at each stop**, NBbang Calculator is the way to go.
