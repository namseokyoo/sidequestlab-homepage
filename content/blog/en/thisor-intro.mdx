## Ever Had This Moment?

"What should we get for lunch - pizza or tacos?"
"Summer vacation - mountains or beach?"
"Dogs or cats - which one's better?"

You know those moments when you're chatting with friends and suddenly you're genuinely curious? What does everyone else think? Is your pick the popular choice or the underdog?

We had the same curiosity. That's why we built **Thisor**.

## What Is Thisor?

**"This or That"** - a real-time voting app where you swipe, tap, and see the results instantly.

Scroll through polls vertically like TikTok, tap the option you prefer, and you're done! Results update in real time, so you can see what everyone else is choosing right at this moment.

## Key Features

### Vote Feed - Swipe Through Polls

Explore a stream of fun polls with TikTok-style vertical swiping. One swipe for a new poll, another swipe for the next. An endless flow of interesting questions awaits.

Pizza vs Burgers, Summer vs Winter, Morning Person vs Night Owl... you'll discover matchups you never thought to ask about.

### 1-Second Voting - Tap and Done

Tap your favorite option and your vote is in! No complicated steps, no sign-up required - it literally takes one second to participate.

After voting, an animated results bar appears showing how others have voted. "Wow, so many people agree with me!" or "I'm in the minority on this one!" - that's half the fun.

### Create Polls - Got a Question for Your Friends?

Can't decide what to have for dinner? Create your own poll! Just enter a title and two options, and your poll is live.

You can set the voting window from 1 minute to 1 hour, and share the link with friends so everyone can join in.
