## Why Is Splitting Bills So Complicated?

After a group dinner or outing, there's always that awkward moment: **settling the bill**.

"Wait, I paid $100 on my card... and someone paid $30 in cash?"

"What about the people who didn't drink?"

"So who owes what to whom?"

Figuring it out in a group chat with a calculator gets confusing fast. Especially when there are many people or multiple payments involved.

We had the same problem. That's why we built **NBbang Calculator**.

## What is NBbang Calculator?

**NBbang Calculator** is a free web service that simplifies group expense splitting.

- Who paid how much
- How much each person owes
- Who needs to pay whom

All visible at a glance. No app download needed - just use it in your web browser.

## How to Use

NBbang Calculator lets you complete your settlement in 4 simple steps.

### Step 1: Add Participants

First, add everyone who's part of the settlement.

1. Go to [nbbang.click](https://nbbang.click)
2. Enter each participant's name and click add
3. Repeat until everyone is added

Use real names or nicknames - whatever makes it easy to identify everyone later.

### Step 2: Add Rounds

One of NBbang Calculator's key features is **round (session) management**.

Group outings often have multiple rounds. First round dinner, second round drinks, third round karaoke... But different people often participate in each round.

**With the round feature, you can:**

- Round 1 (Dinner): All 6 people participate
- Round 2 (Drinks): Only 4 people participate
- Round 3 (Karaoke): Only 3 people participate

Set different participants to share costs for each round.

**How to add rounds:**

1. Click the "Add Round" button
2. Enter a round name (e.g., "Dinner", "Drinks")
3. Add as many rounds as needed

Organizing by rounds helps you manage expenses systematically.

### Step 3: Enter Expenses

Now enter the payment details for each round.

1. Select the round for this expense
2. Select who paid (the payer)
3. Enter the payment amount
4. Select who should split this cost

**Let's look at a real example:**

**Round 1: Dinner (all 6 people)**
- Payer: John
- Amount: $150
- Participants: Select all

**Round 2: Drinks (only 4 people)**
- Payer: Sarah
- Amount: $80
- Participants: Select only John, Sarah, Mike, and Lisa

**Round 3: Karaoke (only 3 people)**
- Payer: Mike
- Amount: $45
- Participants: Select only John, Mike, and Lisa

You can flexibly set who shares each expense.

### Step 4: View Settlement Results

Once all payments are entered, NBbang Calculator automatically calculates the optimal settlement.

The settlement results show:

- **Amount each person owes**: The total each person needs to pay
- **Settlement details**: Who pays whom and how much

Just send the money via Venmo, PayPal, or your preferred payment app, and you're done.
