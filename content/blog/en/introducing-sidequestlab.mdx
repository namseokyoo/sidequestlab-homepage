Hello! We are **SidequestLab**.

Today, through this blog, we want to introduce our team and share the projects we're building.

## What is SidequestLab?

SidequestLab is "a laboratory that creates value through various side projects."

It doesn't have to be a big project. Our goal is to start from small ideas and deliver real value to users.

## Our Projects

### 1. N-Bang Calculator

Have you ever had trouble splitting bills after gatherings or dinners? The **N-Bang Calculator** solves this problem.

- Who paid how much
- Who needs to pay what

You can see it all at a glance. Try it now at [nbbang.click](https://nbbang.click)!

### 2. Pomodoro Timer

When you need to focus, nothing beats the Pomodoro technique. Boost your productivity with cycles of 25-minute focus and 5-minute breaks.

### 3. Todo App

A simple and intuitive todo management app. We focused solely on task management without complex features.

## Future Plans

We will continue to explore new ideas and quickly build prototypes to validate them.

- **Embracing User Feedback**: Your opinions are a great source of strength for us
- **Continuous Improvement**: We improve things one step at a time
- **New Challenges**: We plan to introduce more side projects

Through this blog, we'll share development stories, project updates, and news from our team.

Thank you for your interest and support!
