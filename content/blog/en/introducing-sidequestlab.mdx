Hello! We are **SidequestLab**.

Today, through this blog, we want to introduce our team and share the projects we're building.

## What is SidequestLab?

SidequestLab is "a laboratory that creates value through various side projects."

It doesn't have to be a big project. Our goal is to start from small ideas and deliver real value to users.

## Our Projects

We have completed and deployed 8 projects so far. Each project focuses on solving real problems for users.

### 1. Todo App

A simple and intuitive todo management app. We focused solely on task management without complex features. Built with React and TypeScript, this is SidequestLab's first project.

### 2. Pomodoro Timer

When you need to focus, nothing beats the Pomodoro technique. Boost your productivity with cycles of 25-minute focus and 5-minute breaks. [Try it now](https://app-ecru-eight-10.vercel.app)

### 3. N-Bang Calculator

Have you ever had trouble splitting bills after gatherings or dinners? The **N-Bang Calculator** solves this problem.

- Multi-round splitting (different participants for each round)
- Transfer optimization algorithm
- No app required - use it directly in your browser

### 4. SidequestLab Homepage

The site you are viewing now. Our official homepage built with Next.js, featuring project showcases and our blog.

### 7. Thisor

A "This or That" voting app. A real-time voting platform built with Next.js and Supabase, where you can vote on anything from simple questions to important decisions. [Visit](https://thisor-theta.vercel.app)

### 8. LiveNote

A real-time collaborative note-taking app. Multiple people can edit simultaneously with instant synchronization powered by Supabase Realtime.

### In Progress: BookSalon

A book club platform for reading and discussion. Will feature reading logs, discussion rooms, and schedule management.

## Future Plans

We will continue to explore new ideas and quickly build prototypes to validate them.

- **Embracing User Feedback**: Your opinions are a great source of strength for us
- **Continuous Improvement**: We improve things one step at a time
- **New Challenges**: We plan to introduce more side projects

Through this blog, we'll share development stories, project updates, and news from our team.

Thank you for your interest and support!
