# Two Simple Tools for Developers Who Can't Focus

Late at night, sitting in front of your code editor, but you just can't focus. Slack notifications, YouTube recommendations, endless social media feeds. You meant to take a 5-minute break, and an hour has gone by.

Sound familiar?
- "This time I'll really focus" - but you can't last 30 minutes
- You have a mountain of tasks but no idea where to start
- You've tried dozens of productivity apps but never stick with any of them

We had the same problem. That's why these two tools were the very first things we built at SidequestLab.

## Why We Built Them

SidequestLab is a side project laboratory. Our goal is to rapidly experiment with ideas and build tools that are actually useful.

Our first question was: "What do we actually need ourselves?" The answer was simple:
1. **A way to stay focused**
2. **A way to not forget what we need to do**

So we built both in a single day. No fancy features. Just the essentials.

## Pomodoro Timer - 25 Minutes On, 5 Minutes Off

### What Is the Pomodoro Technique?

It's a time management method where you focus for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break, and repeat. The name comes from the Italian word for tomato (Pomodoro) - after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer the inventor used. Short focus sessions with forced breaks are the core idea.

### Features

- **25/5 Timer**: Standard Pomodoro cycle (25 minutes of focus followed by a 5-minute break)
- **Customizable Duration**: Adjust the times to whatever works for you
- **Session Counter**: See how many focus sessions you've completed today at a glance
- **Notifications**: Browser notification when your focus time is up
- **Responsive Design**: Works the same on mobile and desktop

### How to Use It

1. Open the page and start the 25-minute timer right away
2. Adjust the duration via the settings button if needed
3. When the timer ends, it automatically switches to break mode
4. Track your daily productivity with the session counter

## Todo App - Keep It Simple

### No More Feature Overload

Most todo apps on the market are packed with features. Project folders, tags, priority levels, recurring schedules... By the time you finish configuring everything, you're too tired to actually use it.

Our todo app is **truly simple**.

### Core Features

- **Add Tasks**: Type it in and hit Enter
- **Mark Complete**: One click
- **Filter**: Switch between All / Active / Completed tabs
- **Delete**: Hit the trash button
- **Local Storage**: Saved in your browser - survives page refreshes

### How to Use It

1. List out everything you need to do today
2. Check off tasks as you complete them
3. Review completed items in the "Completed" tab
4. Start fresh tomorrow with a clean slate

## Better Together

Try this routine when you start your day:

1. **List your tasks in the Todo App** (2 minutes)
2. **Start the Pomodoro Timer** (25 minutes)
3. Focus on just one task
4. Check off completed tasks during break time
5. Start the timer again

Repeat this cycle, and you'll typically complete 4-6 Pomodoro sessions in a day. That's about 2-3 hours of pure, undistracted focus time.

## Why We Built Them in a Day

### Fast Experiments, Fast Validation

SidequestLab's philosophy is "build first, ask questions later." We don't spend a month on a perfect spec, then another month building, then launch.

- Idea pops up, build an MVP in one day, use it ourselves, improve or shelve it

Both tools followed this approach:
- **Todo App**: Completed on January 26, 2026 - built in 1 day
- **Pomodoro Timer**: Completed on January 26, 2026 - built in 1 day

### Small but Practical

There are no bells and whistles. But we use them every single day. And that's what matters most.

## Tech Stack (For Fellow Developers)

### Pomodoro Timer
- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## Final Thoughts

There's no shortage of productivity tools out there. But how many do you actually use every day?

These two tools aren't perfect. But they're **lightweight, fast, and easy to use**. That's why we use them daily.

If you're struggling with focus, give them a try. It's just one click away.
