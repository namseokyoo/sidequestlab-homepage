## Which Tool Should You Use?

There is no single best tool. It depends on the situation.

### Simple Equal Split - "Let's just divide it evenly"

For a quick lunch split where everyone pays the same amount, **Venmo** or **Zelle** gets the job done fast. Request money from each person and you are settled in minutes.

### Some People Skipped a Round - "I didn't go to the bar after"

When part of the group leaves early or joins late, a simple equal split is not fair. **NBbang Calculator** lets you set different participants for each round, so everyone pays only for what they were actually part of.

### Travel Expenses - "I got the hotel, you got the meals"

On a weekend trip where different people covered different expenses, things get tangled fast. **Splitwise** is great for tracking expenses over multiple days. **NBbang Calculator** is ideal when you want to settle everything at the end with the fewest possible transfers.

### Roommate Expenses - "Monthly rent and utilities"

For recurring shared costs like rent, groceries, and utilities, **Splitwise** shines. It tracks ongoing balances and reminds people to pay up.

## Summary

| Situation | Recommended Tool |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Quick equal split | Venmo, Zelle |
| Multi-stop group outing | NBbang Calculator |
| Complex travel expenses | NBbang Calculator, Splitwise |
| Ongoing roommate costs | Splitwise |
| No app, no sign-up | NBbang Calculator |
| Bank-to-bank transfer | Zelle |

Every tool has its strengths. For a straightforward equal split, your existing payment app works fine. But when the math gets complicated, with multiple rounds, different participants, and overlapping payments, a dedicated calculator like NBbang makes the difference.

What we have found from building this tool is that **the more complex the split, the more valuable a purpose-built calculator becomes**.
